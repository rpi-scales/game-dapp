In General:
    To interact with a truffle project you can either run a test file or use the console. Using the 
console is allows you to see the output of every line of code, but requires the user to write each line 
of code out every time they run the test.

Using the Console: 
	When using the console the user has to compiling and migrate the project separately  using the 
$ truffle compile and the $ truffle migrate commands. Then the user can enter the developer console 
by using the $ truffle console command. Once in the developer console the user can test functions 
separately . Below I have put the MetaCoin tests that Truffle has in their documentations.

MetaCoin Example:
	let instance = await MetaCoin.deployed()
	let accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts()
	let balance = await instance.getBalance(accounts[0])
	balance.toNumber()
	let ether = await instance.getBalanceInEth(accounts[0])
	ether.toNumber()
	instance.sendCoin(accounts[1], 500)
	let received = await instance.getBalance(accounts[1])
	received.toNumber()
	let newBalance = await instance.getBalance(accounts[0])
	newBalance.toNumber()

Using a Test File:
	When using a test file the user can create a .sol test file or a .js test file. These files are 
located in the test folder in the project. The user runs these tests by using the $ truffle test command.
